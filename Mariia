life is tumultuous
I don't like beans
I recommend the book for reading "1984" by George Orwell
                         This book is about those who disagree being dispersed. A person 
                         who is unprofitable to the regime simply ceases to exist, and no one
                         has the right to remember him or her. Thus, Orwell's dystopia is a
                         rethinking of the concept of totalitarianism, dictatorship, and the 
                         measures that political regimes are capable of taking to maintain power and control society.
 The word "Entschuldigung" is a more formal form of apology
